# BUSINESS_CASE_STUDY_WALMART
Data-Driven Customer Profiling, Spending Pattern Evaluation, and Actionable Marketing Recommendations using EDA, CLT-based Statistical Validation, and Conditional Probability Insights
Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive customer spending analysis for Walmart using transactional
data. The objective is to understand purchasing behavior across different customer segments and
derive data-driven recommendations to support business decision-making.
Business Objective
To analyze customer purchase patterns based on gender, age, marital status, and city category,
and to evaluate whether statistically significant differences exist in spending behavior. The study
further aims to translate analytical findings into actionable business strategies.
Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 5,370 customer transactions with 10 attributes, including purchase amount,
gender, age group, city category, marital status, and duration of stay in the current city. Both
categorical and numerical variables are present, enabling detailed segmentation analysis.
Analysis Workflow
• Data Understanding: Dataset shape, data types, and statistical summaries.
• Data Cleaning: Missing value checks, categorical conversion, and ordered age groups.
• Exploratory Data Analysis: Univariate and bivariate visualizations.
• Statistical Analysis: Confidence intervals and comparison of mean spending.
• Segmentation Analysis: Gender, age, marital status, and city-based comparisons.
• Insight Generation: Business interpretation using Central Limit Theorem principles.
Tools & Technologies
• Python
• Pandas, NumPy
• Matplotlib, Seaborn
• SciPy (Statistical Analysis)
• Jupyter Notebook
Key Insights
The analysis indicates that male customers spend more per transaction on average than female
customers, with non-overlapping confidence intervals confirming statistical significance. Customers
aged 26–55 represent the highest spending group, while city category influences overall purchase
distribution. Marital status does not show a significant impact on spending behavior.
Business Recommendations
• Design targeted marketing campaigns for high-spending male customer segments.
• Focus promotional strategies on customers aged 26–55.
• Optimize inventory allocation based on city-level demand patterns.
• Introduce loyalty programs for long-term city residents.
• Avoid over-segmentation based on marital status due to minimal impact.
